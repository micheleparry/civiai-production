│   ├── marketing/         # Marketing materials
│   └── pricing/           # Pricing analysis
├── README.md              # Project overview
├── .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
└── docker-compose.yml    # Local development (optional)
```

### Step 1.3: Preparing Environment Variables

Production applications require environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys and database credentials. We'll need to prepare these for both local development and production deployment.

**Required Environment Variables for CiviAI:**

```bash
# Django Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com,*.railway.app

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# AI Integration
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Email Configuration (optional)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Security Settings
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

### Step 1.4: Optimizing for Production Performance

Before deployment, we need to optimize the code for production performance and security:

**Django Optimizations:**
- Enable static file compression
- Configure database connection pooling

    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "gunicorn civiai_project.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health/"
  }
}
```

### Step 1.6: Database Migration Strategy

For production deployment, we need a strategy for database setup and migrations:

**Initial Database Setup:**
1. Create production database schema
2. Run Django migrations
3. Load initial data (sample properties, permit types)
4. Create superuser account
5. Configure backup strategy

**Migration Commands:**
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py load_sample_data
```

### Step 1.7: Testing Strategy

Before deployment, we need to ensure everything works correctly:

**Local Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Django server starts without errors

   - Select the "Free" plan for public repositories
   - You can upgrade later if you need private repositories

### Step 2.2: Understanding GitHub Concepts

Before creating your repository, it's helpful to understand key GitHub concepts:

**Repository (Repo):** A container for your project that includes all files, folders, and version history. Think of it as a project folder that tracks all changes over time.

**Commit:** A snapshot of your code at a specific point in time. Each commit includes a message describing what changed.

**Branch:** A parallel version of your code. The main branch (usually called "main" or "master") contains your production code.

**Push:** Uploading your local code changes to GitHub.

**Pull:** Downloading the latest code changes from GitHub to your local computer.

**README.md:** A file that describes your project, how to install it, and how to use it.

### Step 2.3: Creating Your CiviAI Repository

Now you'll create a repository specifically for your CiviAI project.

**Step-by-Step Repository Creation:**

1. **Navigate to Repository Creation**
   - Once logged into GitHub, click the "+" icon in the top right corner

   - **Repository name:** Enter "civiai-platform" or "civiai-municipal-planning"
   - **Description:** Enter "AI-Powered Municipal Planning Platform - Transform your planning department with intelligent automation"
   - **Visibility:** Choose "Public" (this allows others to see and contribute)
   - **Initialize repository:** Check "Add a README file"
   - **Add .gitignore:** Select "Python" from the dropdown
   - **Choose a license:** Select "MIT License" for open source

3. **Create the Repository**
   - Click "Create repository"
   - You'll be taken to your new repository page

### Step 2.4: Understanding Your Repository Structure

Your new repository will have several important files:

**README.md:** This file will contain your project description, installation instructions, and usage guide. We'll customize this for CiviAI.

**.gitignore:** This file tells Git which files to ignore (like temporary files, secrets, and dependencies). The Python template includes common files to ignore.

**LICENSE:** The MIT license allows others to use your code freely while protecting you from liability.

### Step 2.5: Customizing Your README.md

The README.md file is the first thing people see when they visit your repository. Let's create a professional README for CiviAI.

**Click on README.md in your repository, then click the pencil icon to edit it. Replace the content with:**

```markdown
