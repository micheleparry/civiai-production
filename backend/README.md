```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
DB_NAME=civiai_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your-password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```

### Customizing for Your City

1. **Update City Information**
   - Edit `civiai_project/settings.py` CIVIAI_SETTINGS
   - Modify templates to reflect your city name and contact info

2. **Configure Zoning Rules**
   - Use the admin interface at `/admin/`
   - Add your city's zoning districts and rules
   - Configure permit types and fee structures

3. **Load Property Data**
   - Import your property/parcel data
   - Update the Property model as needed for your data structure

## API Endpoints

### Public API
- `GET /api/property/<id>/` - Get property information
- `POST /api/calculate-fee/` - Calculate permit fees
- `POST /api/compliance-check/` - Run compliance check
- `GET /api/dashboard-stats/` - Get dashboard statistics

### Admin Features
- Property management
- Permit type configuration
- Zoning rules management
- Application review and approval

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. **Connect to GitHub**
   - Push your code to a GitHub repository
   - Connect the repository to Vercel

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
